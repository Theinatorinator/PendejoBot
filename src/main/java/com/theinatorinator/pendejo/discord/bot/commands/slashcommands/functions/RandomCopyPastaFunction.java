            "I do not speak for the whole sub, and I'm pretty sure many of the other Caustics are less cynical, way more tolerant and understanding than me, but I do not welcome you here, the hate I've got for Wraith mains cannot be simply described with words, both as enemies and as teammates, always pretentious, arrogant, smug little goblins who think they're the next Aceu/Faide. It always brings a smile to my face to finish these cocky rodents who thought they could push then pussy out with their tactical and get away with it. I do not accept you as one of us, I'm sure that last sentence doesn't matter at all, and I'm well aware that saying all this is pointless, rude, uncalled for and unnecessarily toxic. I'm just an asshole venting (pun intended)",

            "I will do anything for Wattson to be real I will sacrifice my soul to the devil himself just to make her real as I open the door and greet me after a stressful day at work hearing her french accent makes my day better and my spine tingle as we hold each other tightly in the couch watching and laughing at the latest episode of south park as we make up puns involving electricity along the way as our child goes home from school and complains about him/her day we then comfort him/her and make sure everything will be alright for it is part of life as she groans after hearing her mothers puns for the 15th time today as we both lay in our bed I hold her tightly and then I wake up alone in the real world ending my wonderful dream and realizing I'm a sad sack of shit who plays apex instead of doing his assignments given by the teacher I cry as I realize she is never gonna be real that she is just a fictional character created by respawn I just can't take it anymore bro's I'm gonna find a way to bring her to our world no one will stop me no one.....",

            "God, I wish Wattson was actually real. Everyday I daydream about coming home after a long, stresfull day at work and start beating the shit out of her, while our child looks in horror.I daydream about coming home after a night of drinking with the lads and slapping the everliving crap out of her dumbass face, while maimg puns. But no, I don't even have a job, nor am I old enough to drink(like that will stop me) and I have to take it all out on my little brother instead of a dumbass ugly French waifu.\n",

                    "I'm gonna preface this with an introduction. I am a 38 year old Caustic main. I've played the game since day 1, and even though I can only play a few hours a week (wife, 3 kids), I would say I'm pretty good at the game (0.48 KDR). I love Wattson players. They are super wholesome, never DC, and like to bunker down and camp with me.\n" +

                    "The other day, I was playing some Apex, and I decided to make a risky play and land at Orbital Cannon. After around 5 minutes of looting (and both of my teammates (Octane and Wraith) DCing after hotdropping), I started moving out, when I noticed a Wattson in the next room (please fix footsteps)! I ran up to her with my RE-45 and cracked her. She started tap-strafing everywhere so I threw my gas grenade and 3 gas canister and she eventually got knocked. Seeing that it seemed like she was a solo, I used a finisher on her. I was pretty happy as it was my first kill since yesterday, but then as time went on I started feeling bad (post gas clarity if you will). I realized I probably ruined that Wattson's day, and since I know how wholesome they are, I just can't get over it. On the other hand, it was my first kill in 5 games and I went on to get a record 4 kills that match. So Reddit, am I the asshole?",

            "Holy fucking shit. I want to bang Wattson from Apex Legends so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I load up the game I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every r/apexlegends_porn post there is of her. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with Wattson. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Wattson's tight french pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/french babies.\n" +

                    "Fuck, my fucking mom caught me with the baguette from the kitchen counter. I dressed it in my sister's skirt and went to fucking town. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my PC. I might not ever get to see Wattson. Im scared\n" +
